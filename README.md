## Face Recognition Project <br>
This project is aimed at implementing face recognition using Python, OpenCV (cv2), <br>
and the face recognition library, along with a cascade classifier. Face recognition has numerous applications, <br>
including security systems, attendance tracking, and personalized user experiences.




## Features <br>
Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's cascade classifier for detecting faces in images or video streams. <br>
Face Recognition: Integrates the face recognition library to recognize faces based on pre-trained models or custom-trained models. <br>
Flexible Input: Supports both image files and video streams as input for face recognition. <br>
Easy-to-Use Interface: Provides a straightforward interface for users to interact with the face recognition system. <br>
Dependencies <br>
Python 3.x <br>
OpenCV (cv2) <br>
face_recognition library <br>
